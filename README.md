# Q-Safe-Forward-Secrecy


## Usage
* Install everything: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Run the server: `python3 server.py`
* Run the client: `python3 client.py`
* Send anything you want

## Notes
* We use CRLF (yes, Linux users, we hate you)
* This is not really a client-server architecture, it's more like a initiator-acceptor architecture (yes yes, go finish your architecture degree)
